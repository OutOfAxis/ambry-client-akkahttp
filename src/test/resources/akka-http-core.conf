    # single host endpoint is allowed to establish. Must be greater than zero.
    max-connections = 2

    # The minimum number of parallel connections that a pool should keep alive ("hot").
    # If the number of connections is falling below the given threshold, new ones are being spawned.
    # You can use this setting to build a hot pool of "always on" connections.
    # Default is 0, meaning there might be no active connection at given moment.
    # Keep in mind that `min-connections` should be smaller than `max-connections` or equal
    min-connections = 0

    # (if the request can be safely retried) before giving up and returning an error.
    # Set to zero to completely disable request retries.

    # The maximum number of open requests accepted into the pool across all
    # materializations of any of its client flows.
    # Protects against (accidentally) overloading a single pool with too many client flow materializations.
    # Note that with N concurrent materializations the max number of open request in the pool
    # will never exceed N * max-connections * pipelining-limit.
    # Must be a power of 2 and > 0!
    max-open-requests = 1024
//    max-open-requests = 32

    # The maximum number of requests that are dispatched to the target host in
    # batch-mode across a single connection (HTTP pipelining).
    # A setting of 1 disables HTTP pipelining, since only one request per
    # connection can be "in flight" at any time.
    # Set to higher values to enable HTTP pipelining.
    # This value must be > 0.
    # (Note that, independently of this setting, pipelining will never be done
    # on a connection that still has a non-idempotent request in flight.
    #
    # Before increasing this value, make sure you understand the effects of head-of-line blocking.
    # Using a connection pool, a request may be issued on a connection where a previous
    # long-running request hasn't finished yet. The response to the pipelined requests may then be stuck
    # behind the response of the long-running previous requests on the server. This may introduce an
    # unwanted "coupling" of run time between otherwise unrelated requests.

    # See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.3.2 for more info.)

      # Note that it is not necessarily a problem to set this to a high value as all stream operations
      # are always properly backpressured.
      # Nevertheless you might want to apply some limit in order to prevent a single client from consuming
      # an excessive amount of server resources.

      # Set to `infinite` to completely disable entity length checks. (Even then you can still apply one
      # programmatically via `withSizeLimit`.)
