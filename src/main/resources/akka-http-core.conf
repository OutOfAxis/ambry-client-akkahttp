    # The time after which an idle connection will be automatically closed.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable idle connection timeouts.
    idle-timeout = infinite

    # Defines the default time period within which the application has to
    # produce an HttpResponse for any given HttpRequest it received.
    # The timeout begins to run when the *end* of the request has been
    # received, so even potentially long uploads can have a short timeout.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeout checking.
    #
    # If this setting is not `infinite` the HTTP server layer attaches a
    # `Timeout-Access` header to the request, which enables programmatic
    # customization of the timeout period and timeout response for each
    # request individually.
    request-timeout = infinite

    # The time period within which the TCP binding process must be completed.
    bind-timeout = 1s

    # The time period the HTTP server implementation will keep a connection open after
    # all data has been delivered to the network layer. This setting is similar to the SO_LINGER socket option
    # but does not only include the OS-level socket but also covers the Akka IO / Akka Streams network stack.
    # The setting is an extra precaution that prevents clients from keeping open a connection that is
    # already considered completed from the server side.
    #
    # If the network level buffers (including the Akka Stream / Akka IO networking stack buffers)
    # contains more data than can be transferred to the client in the given time when the server-side considers
    # to be finished with this connection, the client may encounter a connection reset.
    #
    # Set to 'infinite' to disable automatic connection closure (which will risk to leak connections).
    linger-timeout = 1 min

    # The maximum number of concurrently accepted connections when using the
    # `Http().bindAndHandle` methods.
    #
    # This setting doesn't apply to the `Http().bind` method which will still
    # deliver an unlimited backpressured stream of incoming connections.
    #
    # Note, that this setting limits the number of the connections on a best-effort basis.
    # It does *not* strictly guarantee that the number of established TCP connections will never
    # exceed the limit (but it will be approximately correct) because connection termination happens
    # asynchronously. It also does *not* guarantee that the number of concurrently active handler
    # flow materializations will never exceed the limit for the reason that it is impossible to reliably
    # detect when a materialization has ended.
    max-connections = 1024

    # The maximum number of requests that are accepted (and dispatched to
    # the application) on one single connection before the first request
    # has to be completed.
    # Incoming requests that would cause the pipelining limit to be exceeded
    # are not read from the connections socket so as to build up "back-pressure"
    # to the client via TCP flow control.
    # A setting of 1 disables HTTP pipelining, since only one request per
    # connection can be "open" (i.e. being processed by the application) at any
    # time. Set to higher values to enable HTTP pipelining.
    # This value must be > 0 and <= 1024.
    pipelining-limit = 16




    # If this setting is empty the server only accepts requests that carry a
    # non-empty `Host` header. Otherwise it responds with `400 Bad Request`.
    # Set to a non-empty value to be used in lieu of a missing or empty `Host`
    # header to make the server accept such requests.
    # Note that the server will never accept HTTP/1.1 request without a `Host`
    # header, i.e. this setting only affects HTTP/1.1 requests with an empty
    # `Host` header as well as HTTP/1.0 requests.
    # Examples: `www.spray.io` or `example.com:8080`
    default-host-header = ""
